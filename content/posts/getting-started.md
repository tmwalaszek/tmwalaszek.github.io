Welcome to your new Hugo blog! This is your first post written in **Markdown**.

## What is Hugo?

Hugo is a fast and modern static site generator written in Go. It's perfect for building blogs, portfolios, and documentation sites.

### Key Features

- **Blazing fast** build times
- **Markdown** support out of the box
- Simple and clean structure
- No database required

## Writing in Markdown

Markdown makes it super easy to format your content. Here are some basics:

### Text Formatting

You can use *italic*, **bold**, or ***bold italic*** text. You can also use ~~strikethrough~~.

### Lists

Unordered list:
- First item
- Second item
- Third item

Ordered list:
1. First step
2. Second step
3. Third step

### Code

Inline code looks like `this`.

Code blocks look like this:

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, Hugo!")
```

```javascript
function greet() {
    console.log("Hello from JavaScript!");
}
```

### Blockquotes

### Images

You can add images like this:
```markdown

```

## Adding New Posts

To add a new post, just create a new `.md` file in the `content/posts/` directory:

```bash
hugo new posts/my-new-post.md
```

That's it! Start writing and enjoy your blogging journey.
